# Web Development : Back-End
- often referred to as server-side development, encompasses everything that happens behind the scenes of a website or application and is not directly visible to the user
- the infrastructure that powers the front end and makes the application functional
- handles the logic, data storage, and server-side processing that power the application and enable the "front end" (or client-side) to function
- main components are the client, server and database

### Client
- any device or software that accesses and interacts with a server
- the part that the user sees

### Server
-  the physical or virtual computer that hosts the application and handles requests from users' browsers

### Database
- where all the application's data is stored and managed

### How it Works
1. Client: user types `www.google.com` into the browser
    - a request gets sent to the server
2. Server: the server responds by sending over the HTML, CSS and Javascript files for that particular website
    - these files gets sent back to the browser and the browser renders the webpage
3. Database: if the website requires some data the server fetches the data from the database
    - once it gets the data it adds the data to the  HTML, CSS and Javascript files then sends the entire bundle back to the browser

### Common Back-End Languages
**Backend language choice often depends on factors such as project requirements, scalability needs, team expertise, and desired performance characteristics**
- **Python**
    - Known for its readability and extensive libraries, with popular frameworks like Django and Flask.
- **Java**
    - A robust, object-oriented language widely used for enterprise-level applications and Android development, supported by frameworks like Spring Boot.
- **JavaScript (Node.js)**
    - While primarily a frontend language, Node.js allows JavaScript to be used on the backend, enabling full-stack JavaScript development with frameworks like Express.js.
- **PHP**
    - Historically a very popular language for web development, powering a significant portion of the internet, with frameworks like Laravel and Symfony.
- **Ruby**
    - Known for its developer-friendliness and the Ruby on Rails framework, which emphasizes convention over configuration.
- **Go (Golang)**
    - Developed by Google, Go is known for its performance and concurrency features, making it suitable for scalable systems.
- **C#**
    - A Microsoft-developed language primarily used with the .NET framework for building Windows applications and web services.

### Back-End Frameworks
pre-built structures and tools that facilitate the creation of the server-side components of web applications
- they provide a structured environment with predefined libraries, modules, and conventions to streamline development, manage server-side logic, interact with databases, handle authentication, and create APIs for communication with the frontend
- **Examples of popular backend frameworks include**
    - Django and Flask (Python)
        - Flask better suited to beginners and small projects
        - Django suited more for larger commercial projects
    - Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
    - Spring (Java)
    - Express.js (Node.js/JavaScript)
    - Laravel (PHP)
    - ASP.NET Core (C#)
