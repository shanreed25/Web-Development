# Web Development : Back-End
- often referred to as server-side development, encompasses everything that happens behind the scenes of a website or application and is not directly visible to the user
- the infrastructure that powers the front end and makes the application functional
- handles the logic, data storage, and server-side processing that power the application and enable the "front end" (or client-side) to function
- main components are the client, server and database
### Client
- any device or software that accesses and interacts with a server
- the part that the user sees

### Server
-  the physical or virtual computer that hosts the application and handles requests from users' browsers

### Database
- where all the application's data is stored and managed

- Client: user types `www.google.com` into the browser
    - a request gets sent to the server
- Server: the server responds by sending over the HTML, CSS and Javascript files for that particular website
    - these files gets sent back to the browser and the browser renders the webpage
- Database: if the website requires some data the server fetches the data from the database
    - once it gets the data it adds the data to the  HTML, CSS and Javascript files then sends the entire bundle back to the browser
